This project is a Scala extension for [reactor-core](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core).

Using reactor-core project as it is in scala code will look ugly because
a lot of methods use Java 8 lambda which is not compatible with Scala lambda.
This will force Scala code to use anonymous class which turns ugly.

So instead of

    val mono = Mono.just(1)
                   .map(new java.util.function.Function[Int, String] {
                       def apply(t: Int): String = t.toString
                   })
                   
it becomes

    val mono = SMono.just(1).map(_.toString)

This extension will also return scala's `scala.collection.immutable.Stream` instead of Java's `java.util.stream.Stream`
and `scala.concurrent.Future` instead of `java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`
## Getting it

With SBT:

    libraryDependencies += "io.projectreactor" %% "reactor-scala-extensions" % "0.7.0"

With Gradle:
    
    repositories {
        //maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/' }
        mavenCentral()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        //compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-scala-extensions_2.12:0.7.1-SNAPSHOT
        //compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-scala-extensions_2.13:0.7.0 //for scala 2.13
        compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-scala-extensions_2.12:0.7.0 //for scala 2.12
        //compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-scala-extensions_2.11:0.7.0 //for scala 2.11
    }
